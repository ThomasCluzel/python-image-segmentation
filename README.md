# Picture2Avatar

This project is a simple script that segment an
image to obtain something that looks like a cartoon
with less colors.

## Installation

### For those who want to use

TODO

### For those who want to contribute

```sh
$ pipenv install --dev
```
If you don't want to use `pipenv` it is also possible
to run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then, edit files, add features...

## Usage

TODO: decide a CLI

## TODOs

* add tests with pytest
* design a GUI
* write docs

## Ideas

* split and merge to determine parts of the image
* browse the image to collect all color used then group them
and apply a average color
* remove bits of precision of components RGB -> 3 bits for each?
