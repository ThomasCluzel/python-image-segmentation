# Picture2Avatar

This project is a simple script that segment an
image to obtain something that looks like a cartoon
with less colors.

## Installation

TODO: add a "setup.py" file in the root directory

## Usage

TODO

## TODOs

* setup pipenv
* setup requirements.txt
* add tests
* design a GUI
* write docs

## Ideas

* split and merge to determine parts of the image
* browse the image to collect all color used then group them
and apply a average color
* remove bits of precision of components RGB -> 3 bits for each?
